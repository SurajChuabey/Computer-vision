# Color Classifier

A Computer Vision project for classifying colors in images using machine learning techniques.

## Description

This project implements a color classification system that can identify and categorize different colors in input images. It's part of a larger Computer Vision portfolio demonstrating practical applications of image processing and machine learning.

## Features

- Color detection and classification
- Support for multiple color spaces (RGB, HSV)
- Real-time color classification capabilities
- Easy-to-use interface for image input and processing
